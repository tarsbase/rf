clarification: this is not a guide to lambda calculus for idiots, this is a guide to lambda calculus written by an idiot.

imagine for a second you need to explain our numbering system without ***any*** background. any at all, think about that for a second.

* you have no idea what the number symbols mean
* you have no idea what plus minus or anything mean
* you have no idea of anything

and this isn't limited to just numbering, because almost anything we do on a computer is based around maths, imagine the same for pretty much literally anything.

what you would need is....

**is**...

***is***...
