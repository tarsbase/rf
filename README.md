## Getting Started

What you need to get the generator up and running.

### Prerequisites

Built using Nix.
Nix can be installed with:  
```
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```  

### Installing

Enter the build environment

```
nix-shell --attr env rf.nix
```

Compile the generator

```
nix-build rf.nix
```  

Generate the site

```
./result/site clean
./result/site build
```

And test it out

```
./result/site watch
```

The site will now be avaliable at `localhost:8000`

## Deployment

Site will be completely static, so simply point your server to the `_site` directory
