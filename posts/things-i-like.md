howdy one and all, to my inaugural post.  
what follows is a list of potentially somewhat obscure feelings, that instill a subtle, non-zero amount of joy in me, without reaching levels for me to register them as good feelings.

without further ado:

## lowercase letters

much, i imagine, to the disgust of my english teacher mother, i really enjoy writing entirely in lowercase when i can. i believe it started on irc as a homestuck style (yet subtle enough to not give away being trash) quirk for some sense of identity that was seperate to having an actual personality.

## using the (y) emoji outside of facebook

on facebook, using `(y)` will produce a thumbs up emoji that is different to the current readily and easily avaliable one, so already it's pretty nice. theres something completely different about using it outside of facebook. i once met someone on discord who did the same thing. i have not talked to them since, nor can i remember their name, but i consider them a friend in the same way i consider anyone who uses dvorak a friend

## the jazzy bit in the middle of Fluff's Travels by Phish

shouldn't really need an explanation, [Fluffhead // Fluff's Travels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q54O03orQ4s) is such a good two piece and the jazz bit is the best part.

## the following dialog from "The Point (1971)"

>"if everything has a point, then i must have one too"  
>"he's got a point there!"

## swatch internet time in my shell prompt

one day there'll be enough of us to make swatch beats a standard, until then i'll just await the day my pebble battery dies and i have to go back to a normal watch

## people you know not noticing you in public

all the upsides of being a social person and realising you know a lot more people than you think you do, but with none of the downsides of actually having to talk to people and take your headphones off

## half-assed projects

...of which this post is included. one day i'll finish something and maintain it, but until then theres something comfy about looking into `~/projects` and finding about seven variations on `ta_sdl_game_engine` dating back to highschool

hopefully you enjoyed these half assed ramblings. until next time, peace out, ima' bounce, and carry on my dudes.xvid.h264.mkv
