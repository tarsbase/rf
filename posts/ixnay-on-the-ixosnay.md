dear sister...

by the time you read this, my laptops OS will be dead.

heres how I think it'll go down:

## open source programs

the support for them on nixos is **excellent**, no problems there, if that was all i were doing (and it is about 97% of what i do) it'd be fine.

i still intend 100% to use nix the package manager as the dependency and build environment tool of choice for my personal projects, its too good to not use.

## closed source programs

mainly, ***games***, im an edgy kid i like to play games in my free time, and whenever im on holiday (prime time for playing games all day) i like to be able to *install* them.

this is not an easy task on NixOS.

this is not an easy task at all.

this is a really *really* **really** ***really*** annoying task on nixos.

sometimes they'll *just werk* if you set up a virtual file system

every other time you're better off setting up a VM just to avoid all the library hell you'll have to go through.

## final thoughts

short post, i gotta get around to `dd'ing` a usb and messing up everything.

one day i'll stick to a distro, maybe even one i really really like (like nixos)

it's not you nixos its me. my beard isn't long enough, i have too much of a social life at the moment, i'm not worthy.

until we meet again.

`close nixos || hcra nepo`
