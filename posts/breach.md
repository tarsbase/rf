i sit at my laptop, my *companion* my *friend*

looking out over my **domain**, the world is on fire

the ***moons*** are crumbling, the ***stars*** are dying

i pack my things, the things i *like*, the things i *need*

with an aura of regret, i crawl into a ***comet***

and set my way to the ***stars***, distant, yet bright

sending out **signals** as i go

> im here, im alive

a desperate attempt at making *contact*

i travel, *alone*, *silent*, until i recieve something back

> we're here, we're alive

a blinding blue **vortex** appears in front of me

*painless* and *calm*, it engulfs my small ***comet***

i land on my ***planet***, shiny and new

and send a **message** to the ***stars***

> im home

another ***breach***, theyre only getting *easier*

the **future** is here

`:wq`
