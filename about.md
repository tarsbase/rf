# jokingly
**Regular Flolloping** is:

# technically
**Regular Flolloping** is:

* powered by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)

# pretensiously
**Regular Flolloping** is **Layer 03** of the [Protocol Seven System](https://p7.co.nz) (currently broken)

**Layer 03**, also known as **Psyche**

the complexities of the human brain through the medium of text,  
a carefully and oft not-so-carefully curated mask for the identity that is **tA**,  
a slight variation of common knowledge,  
yet of more importance than the content,  
the characterisation of the reaction to said knowledge
